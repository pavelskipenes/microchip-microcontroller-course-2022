# Assignments
## Session 1

### Task 1
Learn how to open Atmel Studio.
Read the code, what do you think it does?
Learn how to upload code.

### Task 2
Set up a button with pullup. Use this to control the led.

### Task 3
Add aditional logic so that the button toggles the led.


### Task 4 (OPTIONAL)
Add the OLED board.
Find out where the buttons and LEDs connect.
Do something fun with the additional leds and buttons.

## Session 2

### Task 5 - Timer
Get hands on with timers and interupts to toggle leds at exact times.

### Task 6 - PWM
Continuing with timers, use them for pulse width modulation of LEDs

### Task 7 - ADC & UART
Write a UART driver to communicate with the PC. Send ADC values over UART. You can use Microchip Data Visualizer to receive and see the data.

## Session 3
### Task 8
Write an SPI driver and and test it with the OLED screen and provided image/text, read graphics.h!

### Task 9
Use the ADC driver to sample the OV-POT KLAKK and write the result to the screen.

### Task 10 (OPTIONAL)
Use the screen and buttons to make a game! (Suggestion: Simon says)
